# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Peer-to-peer video calling web app built with React 19, TypeScript, and WebRTC. No accounts or tracking — users share human-readable call IDs (format: `adjective-noun-verb`) to connect directly. Optional AES-GCM 256-bit end-to-end encryption. Firebase Realtime Database serves as the signaling server; Firebase Anonymous Auth secures database access.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm install                            # Install dependencies
npm run dev                            # Dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build                          # Production build → dist/
npm run preview                        # Preview production build
npm test                               # Run tests (vitest, watch mode by default)
npm run test:ui                        # Vitest UI dashboard
vitest run path/to/test.test.ts        # Run a single test file
npm run test:coverage                  # Tests with coverage
npx tsc --noEmit                       # Type check (requires firebase.ts)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install  # Fix stale npm cache
```

No local linting/formatting npm scripts are configured. CI runs ESLint and Prettier as blocking checks.

Vitest with jsdom environment. Test mocks in `test/setup.ts` cover Firebase (`.child()` chaining), WebRTC (`RTCPeerConnection`), and crypto APIs. Timeout values (`hookTimeout: 10000`, `testTimeout: 10000`) are configured in `vitest.config.ts` for CI stability.

## Architecture

### Dependency Loading

React 19 and Firebase SDK (v8 compat) are loaded via CDN in `index.html`, not bundled. Only Tailwind CSS and other dev dependencies are npm-managed. The app uses an import map for React module resolution. Firebase is loaded as global `<script>` tags and accessed as the `firebase` global — the `firebase.ts` file initializes it and exports a `db` reference (`firebase.database()`). Do not `import firebase from 'firebase'`.

### Path Aliases

`@/*` maps to `./*` (project root) in both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`.

### WebRTC Signaling Flow

Firebase Realtime Database is the signaling server. Key paths:
- `/calls/{callId}` — SDP offer/answer, ICE candidates, encryption key
- `/users/{userId}/incomingCall` — direct peer ringing (includes `from`, `callId`, `callerAlias`)
- `/status/{userId}` — online presence with timestamps

Call flow: Caller generates call ID → writes SDP offer to Firebase → Joiner reads offer, writes answer → ICE candidates exchanged → direct P2P connection established. All signaling logic lives in `hooks/useWebRTC.ts`.

### Call State Machine

`CallState` enum in `types.ts` manages the lifecycle:

`IDLE` → `LOBBY` → `CREATING_OFFER` → `WAITING_FOR_ANSWER` → `CONNECTED`
`IDLE` → `LOBBY` → `JOINING` → `CREATING_ANSWER` → `CONNECTED`

Special states: `INCOMING_CALL`, `RINGING` (caller ringing a pinned peer), `RECONNECTING`, `DECLINED`, `MEDIA_ERROR`, `ENDED`

The lobby (`enterLobby()`) is entered before creating, joining, or accepting calls — it provides media preview with resolution and E2EE toggles.

### End-to-End Encryption

Optional E2EE in `utils/crypto.ts`:
- AES-GCM 256-bit with per-frame counter-based IVs
- Transform streams on RTCRtpSender/RTCRtpReceiver encoded frames
- Key exchange: caller generates key, joiner imports from `/calls/{callId}/encryptionKey`
- Browser support check: `RTCRtpSender.prototype.createEncodedStreams` existence

### Data Channel Protocol

WebRTC data channel sends JSON messages:
```typescript
{ type: 'chat', payload: string }
{ type: 'control', payload: { type: 'mute' | 'video', value: boolean } }
```

### Key Hooks

- `useWebRTC` — core WebRTC: peer connection, media streams, signaling, reconnection, E2EE, chat, `ringUser()` for calling pinned peers directly
- `useAuth` — Firebase anonymous auth state
- `usePresence` — Firebase presence tracking (online/offline)
- `usePeerStatus` — monitors presence of pinned contacts
- `useDraggable` — drag-and-drop for floating video
- `usePinchToZoom` — pinch-to-zoom on remote video stream

### Shared Icons

Reusable SVG icon components live in `components/icons.tsx`. Import from there instead of defining icons locally in component files. FloatingVideo has unique icons that stay local.

### useWebRTC Stale Closure Pattern

Firebase callbacks (`on('value', ...)`) and WebRTC handlers capture state at registration time. To read current state inside these callbacks, use the sync refs: `callStateRef`, `peerIdRef`, `enableE2EERef`, `isMutedRef`, `isVideoOffRef`, `remoteStreamRef`. Do not read state variables directly in callbacks.

## Firebase Setup

1. Copy `firebase.ts.example` to `firebase.ts` and add config
2. Enable Anonymous Authentication in Firebase Console
3. Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only database`
4. `firebase.ts` is gitignored — never commit credentials
5. Firebase project URL format: `https://{project-id}.web.app` (production) or `https://{project-id}.web.app` / `https://{region}-{project-id}.web.za` for alternate deployments

In CI, `firebase.ts` is generated from GitHub Secrets via `scripts/generate-firebase-config.cjs`. `firebase.ts` does not exist locally until generated. Type checking and builds will fail with a missing module error — this is expected without a local config.

## CI/CD

- **`deploy.yml`**: Deploys to Firebase Hosting on main/master push. Uses `npm ci`, `npx vitest run`, blocking `tsc --noEmit`. PRs get preview deployments (7-day expiry).
- **`pr-check.yml`**: PR checks — tests with coverage, type check, build, security audit (`npm audit`), ESLint, Prettier. All gates are blocking.
- **`dependabot.yml`**: Auto-merges patch/minor updates after CI passes. Major version updates require manual review — evaluate breaking changes and security implications before merging.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build && firebase deploy          # Full deploy
firebase deploy --only database           # Rules only
firebase deploy --only hosting            # Hosting only
```

`firebase.json` configures `dist/` hosting with SPA rewrites and security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options).

## Styling

Tailwind CSS with dark theme and glassmorphism effects. Custom animations in `tailwind.config.js`. Styles in `index.css`.

## Important Constraints

- Call IDs must match `/^[a-z]+-[a-z]+-[a-z]+$/` (validated in `App.tsx`)
- HTTPS required in production (enforced in `utils/security.ts`) for `getUserMedia`
- User IDs are anonymous UUIDs stored in localStorage (`p2p-user-id`)
- Service worker caching may require hard refresh during development
- **Version source of truth**: `package.json` version field. `components/About.tsx` must be manually synced when bumping versions.

### App State Rendering

`App.tsx` renders different views based on `callState`:
- `IDLE`/`ENDED`/`DECLINED` — tabbed main page (New Call, Recent, Pinned, Tools, About)
- `LOBBY` — media preview with resolution/E2EE toggles
- `CREATING_OFFER`/`RINGING`/`JOINING`/`WAITING_FOR_ANSWER`/`CREATING_ANSWER` — connecting overlay
- `CONNECTED`/`RECONNECTING` — fullscreen call with `FloatingVideo` (remote), `LocalVideoPreview` (PiP), `Controls`, `ChatPanel`
- `INCOMING_CALL` — accept/decline dialog
- `MEDIA_ERROR` — error screen with retry

Call history and pinned contacts persist in localStorage via `utils/history.ts` and `utils/pins.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `firebase.ts` module not found | Generate from `firebase.ts.example` or CI will create it from secrets |
| Type check fails | Ensure `firebase.ts` exists; run `npx tsc --noEmit` locally to verify |
| Service worker serves stale content | Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear Application Data in DevTools |
| Tests timeout in CI | Already handled with increased timeouts; 3 tests skipped due to async timing |
| Deployment fails | Check Firebase project URL format and authentication in `firebase.ts` |

Update deployment stats when: version bumps occur, bundle size changes ±10%, or test coverage shifts significantly.

## Deployment Stats (as of v0.1.0)

- **Bundle Size**: ~86 KB (gzipped)
- **Test Coverage**: 94 passing tests (97% coverage)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (only React and browser mapping)
